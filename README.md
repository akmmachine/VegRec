🥗 VegRec — Vegetarian Recipe Recommender
VegRec is an intelligent web-based application that helps users discover delicious vegetarian recipes based on the ingredients they already have at home. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP), inverted indexing, and clustering techniques, the system matches user-provided ingredients to the most suitable recipes from a curated vegetarian dataset.

📌 Project Highlights
🧂 Ingredient-Based Recipe Matching
Users input available ingredients, and the system returns recipes that can be prepared with them.
🧠 NLP & Text Preprocessing
Ingredients are stemmed and vectorized using CountVectorizer and PorterStemmer for normalized matching.
🔍 Inverted Index Search
Fast lookup of recipes containing user-provided ingredients via inverted indexing.
🌐 Cluster-Based Fallback
When no exact match is found, cosine similarity and Agglomerative Clustering are used to find the closest recipe suggestions.
📊 Dynamic Streamlit Interface
Interactive and intuitive UI where users can input ingredients and browse suggested recipes with detailed instructions.

🧾 Dataset Overview

🔧 Workflow Summary
1. Data Preprocessing
Remove punctuation, tokenize and stem ingredients


Normalize ingredient formats


2. Feature Extraction
Use CountVectorizer to vectorize preprocessed ingredient text


Build inverted index for fast ingredient-to-recipe lookup


3. Recipe Recommendation
Exact/Partial Match: Based on overlap of stemmed ingredients


Fallback Matching: Cosine similarity using vectorized ingredients and clustering


4. Clustering
Recipes are grouped using AgglomerativeClustering to improve fallback recommendations



🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
bash
CopyEdit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/VegRec.git
cd VegRec

2. Install dependencies:
bash
CopyEdit
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the app:
bash
